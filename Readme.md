- First we create the app.py, implemented the psutil, flask for backend and rtrieved the cpu and memoty monitor
- Second I created a HTML file with a proper UI
- Used different parameters for preparing

- github : https://github.com/N4si/cloud-native-monitoring-app
- Added the docker file
    - How docker works
        - First initializing the python which is the base image
        - then we define the WORKING DIRECTORY
        - Then copy the requirements.txt 
        - Run the command to install everything from requirements.txt
        - copy the code the application to working directory
        - Set environment variables for the flsk app
        - Expose the port on which the Flask app will run
        - Start the Flask app when the Container is run

- Run docker using  "docker build -t my-flask-app ."

- next step is to deploy in Kubernetes

- ECR share deploy container, publically and privtelly Create a repository to store the images to store then use by containers in kubernetes  

- Instead of creating Repository in ECR website, we are using Boto3 for creating the EC2 repository

- Created the repository using Boto3 successfully. In the Amazon ECR console the repository is properly visiible
